# ATM Management System

## Overview
This project is part of an Object-Oriented Programming with Java (OOPJ) assignment, focusing on building an ATM (Automated Teller Machine) system. The ATM Management System is designed to simulate basic banking functionalities, enabling users to perform transactions such as account balance inquiries, withdrawals, and deposits through a user-friendly interface.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system to ensure authorized access.
- **Account Balance Inquiry**: View the current balance of your account.
- **Withdraw Money**: Withdraw a specific amount from the account, ensuring sufficient balance.
- **Deposit Money**: Deposit funds to your account.
- **Transaction History**: View the record of previous transactions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Paradigm**: Object-Oriented Programming
- **Development Environment**: IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

## Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans
